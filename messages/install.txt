Thankyou for installing the POL eScript Syntax Highlighter Package.
This package does include some more features than just simple syntax highlighting.
It also includes:
Autocomplete for core functions.
A few eScript snippits.
A few colour schemes as put out by the POL Community.
A Hex to Int converter.
Error reporting on compile.

HEX <-> INT
To trigger the hex to int converter, first either highlight or center your cursor on a Hex or Int number.
You can then use either the 
Edit menu > HEX<->INT
Preferences > Pol Server Settings> HEX<->INT
Right Click > Convert To <HEX|INT>
Alt+Shift+C
